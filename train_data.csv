"Atmospheric carbon dioxide variations at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii","Charles D. Keeling, Robert B. Bacastow, Arnold E. Bainbridge, Carl A.Ekdahl Jr., Peter R. Guenther, Lee S. Waterman & John F. S. Chin
",doi:10.3402/tellusa.v28i6.11322,Tellus,1976,"In conjunction with the Antarctic study of atmospheric carbon dioxide discussed in the preceding paper (Keeling et al., 1976), a nearly uninterrupted series of CO2, measurements has been obtained with a continuously recording nondispersive infrared gas analyzer over a period of fourteen years at the Mauna Loa high altitude observatory on the island of Hawaii. The sampled air at the station, as shown by Pales & Keeling (1965), is approximately representative of air above the North Pacific trade wind inversion between 15° and 25° N.","Two major features of the data are a seasonal oscillation and a long term increase. The seasonal oscillation, with little doubt, reflects the integrated uptake and release of CO2, by land plants and soil (Junge & Czeplak, 1968). The amplitude of the seasonal oscillation is maximum in the Arctic (Kelley, 1969) and decreases southward until low values are reached in the mid-southern hemisphere (Bolin & Keeling, 1963). The amplitude also decreases with height above ground and is barely observable in the lower stratosphere (Bolin & Bischof, 1970; Bischof, 1973). The greater amplitude in the northern hemisphere is explained by the greater extent of boreal as com- pared with austral forests and grasslands. The decrease with height occurs because the seasonal oscillation, produced at ground level, is progressively attenuated upward by mixing.","Both the Antarctic and Mauna Loa data show an annual increase in CO2, concentration of the order of 1 ppm (parts per million of dry air). This increase reflects the retention in the air of about half of the CO2, produced by combustion of fossil fuels (Keeling, 1973). The rate of increase has not been strictly proportional to the rate of combustion of fossil fuels in either hemisphere.","In extending the previously published five year record of atmospheric CO2, concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory by eight additional years, new features of CO2, in air near the Hawaiian Islands are revealed, and previously noted features more precisely defined. Sta- tistical analysis of daily and monthly averages of the original continuous data establish a seasonal oscillation described by annual and semiannual harmonic oscillations about a long term trend.","This latter trend, obtained by subtracting the average seasonal oscillation from each of the original 14 years of record, is a rising function of time and is described, within the precision of the data, by either a cubic power series, a 12 month moving average, or a set of seasonally adjusted monthly averages.","The air at Mauna Loa Observatory may be slightly influenced by local processes which cannot be expunged from the record, but the observed long term trend of rising CO2, appears clearly to be in response to increasing amounts of industrial CO2, in the air on a global scale. We are thus convinced of the observatory's suitability to monitor global changes in atmospheric CO2, concentration.",Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have been carried out for the first time,The Long-term Oscillation of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere has been recorded since the 1960s,Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Antarctic and Mauna Loa air have increased over the past 40 years,A new record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations near the Hawaiian Islands has been published,The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen significantly over the past 50 years,A new record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations near the Hawaiian Islands has been published.
Perception of climate change,"James Hansena,1, Makiko Satoa , and Reto Ruedyb",doi:org/10.1073/pnas.1205276109,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,2012,"“Climate dice,”describing the chance of unusually warm or coolseasons, have become more and more“loaded”in the past 30 y,coincident with rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonalmean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher tempera-tures and the range of anomalies has increased. An importantchange is the emergence of a category of summertime extremelyhot outliers, more than three standard deviations (3σ) warmer thanthe climatology of the 1951–1980 base period. This hot extreme,which covered much less than 1% of Earth’s surface during the baseperiod, now typically covers about 10% of the land area. It followsthat we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extremeanomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 andMoscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming becausetheir likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedinglysmall. We discuss practical implications of this substantial, growing,climate change.","The greatest barrier to public recognition of human-madeclimate change is probably the natural variability of local cli-mate. How can a person discern long-term climate change, giventhe notorious variability of local weather and climate from day today and year to year?This question assumes great practical importance because ofthe need for the public to appreciate the significance of human-made global warming. Actions to stem emissions of the gases thatcause global warming are unlikely to approach what is neededuntil the public recognizes that human-made climate change isunderway and perceives that it will have unacceptable conse-quences if effective actions are not taken to slow the climatechange. A recent survey in the United States (1) confirms thatpublic opinion about the existence and importance of globalwarming depends strongly on their perceptions of recent localclimate variations. Early public recognition of climate changeis critical. Stabilizing climate with conditions resembling thoseof the Holocene, the world in which civilization developed, canonly be achieved if rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions beginssoon.","It was suggested decades ago (3) that by the early 21st centurythe informed public should be able to recognize that the frequencyof unusually warm seasons had increased, because the“climatedice,”describing the probability of unusually warm or unusuallycool seasons, would be sufficiently loaded (biased) as to be dis-cernible to the public. Recent high profile heat waves, such asthe one in Texas and Oklahoma in the summer of 2011, raisethe question of whether these extreme events are related tothe on-going global warming trend, which has been attributed witha high degree of confidence to human-made greenhouse gases (4).Summer, when most biological productivity occurs, is probablythe season when climate change will have its biggest impact onhumanity. Global warming causes spring warmth to come earlierand cooler conditions that initiate fall to be delayed. Thus globalwarming not only increases summer warmth, it also protractssummer-like conditions, stealing from both spring and fall.Therefore, we emphasize in this paper how summer temperatureanomalies are changing. However, warmer winters also haveimportant effects, e.g., winter freezes are critical in many regionsfor minimizing future pest and disease outbreaks. Thus weprovide on our Web site (http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/PerceptionsAndDice/) more extensive results for winter thanwe have space for in the present paper.Although we were motivated in this research by an objectiveto expose effects of human-made global warming as soon aspossible, we use an empirical approach that does not requireknowledge of the causes of observed climate change. We alsoavoid any use of global climate models, instead dealing onlywith real world data. Moreover, although the location, extent,and duration of regional temperature anomalies is affected byatmospheric blocking situations, El Niños, La Niñas, and othermeteorological events, there is no need to understand andanalyze the role of these phenomena in our purely empiricalapproach. Theories for the cause of observed global temperaturechange are thus separated as an independent matter.","DiscussionPrincipal  Findings.Seasonal-mean temperature anomalies havechanged dramatically in the past three decades, especially in sum-mer. The probability distribution for temperature anomalies hasshifted more than one standard deviation toward higher values.In addition, the distribution has broadened, the shift being great-er at the high temperature tail of the distribution.The climate dice are now loaded to a degree that a perceptiveperson old enough to remember the climate of 1951–1980 shouldrecognize the existence of climate change, especially in summer.Summers with mean temperature in the category defined as coldin 1951–1980 climatology (mean temperature below−0.43σ),which occurred about one-third of the time in 1951–1980, nowoccur about 10% of the time, while those in the hot category haveincreased from about 33% to about 75% (Fig. 7).","The most important change of the climate dice is the appear-ance of a new category of extremely hot summer anomalies, withmean temperature at least three standard deviations greater thanclimatology. These extreme temperatures were practically absentin the period of climatology, covering only a few tenths of onepercent of the land area, but they are occurring over about 10%of global land area in recent years. The increase of these extremeanomalies, by more than an order of magnitude, implies that wecan say with a high degree of confidence that events such asthe extreme summer heat in the Moscow region in 2010 andTexas in 2011 were a consequence of global warming. Rahmstorfand Coumou (22), using a more elegant mathematical analysis,reached a similar conclusion for the Moscow anomaly.","It is not uncommon for meteorologists to reject global warmingas a cause of these extreme events, offering instead a meteoro-logical explanation. For example, it is said that the Moscow heatwave was caused by an extreme atmospheric“blocking”situation,or the Texas heat wave was caused by La Niña ocean temperaturepatterns. Certainly the locations of extreme anomalies in anygiven case depend on specific weather patterns. However, block-ing patterns and La Niñas have always been common, yet thelarge areas of extreme warming have come into existence onlywith large global warming. Today’s extreme anomalies occur as a result of simultaneous contributions of specific weather pat-terns and global warming.",Global warming has had a significant impact on the weather in the United States,Public recognition of human-made climate change is critical,The frequency of unusually warm summer seasons in the United States has increased in recent decades,The influence of climate change on summer temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific has been examined in more detail than ever before,"The climate dice, which is a measure of the likelihood of a given event occurring, has changed significantly in recent years","Extreme weather events, such as the recent heatwaves in Russia and the United States, are often blamed on global warming"
To Slow or Not to Slow: The Economics of The Greenhouse Effect.,"Nordhaus, W. D.",doi:10.2307/2233864,The Economic Journal,1991,"Over the last decade, scientists have studied extensively the greenhouse effect,
which holds that the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
greenhouse gases (GHGs) is expected to produce global warming and other
significant climatic changes over the next century. Along with the scientific
research have come growing alarm and calls for drastic curbs on the emissions
of greenhouse gases, as for example the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC [I990]) and the Second World Climate Conference
(October I990). To date, these call to arms for forceful measures to slow
greenhouse warming have been made without any serious attempt to weigh the
costs and benefits of climatic change or alternative control strategies","The present study presents a simple approach for analyzing policies to slow climate change. We begin by summarizing the elements of an economic analysis of different approaches to controlling greenhouse warming. We then sketch a mathematical model of economic growth that links the economy, emissions, and climate changes and summarize the empirical evidence on the costs of reducing emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases and on the damages from greenhouse warming, relying primarily on data for the United States. The different sections are then integrated to provide estimates of the efficient reduction of greenhouse gases, after which the final section summarizes the major results","In weighing climate-change policies, the prospects for global warming and the linkage between human activities and the emissions of GHGs form a key building block. This study uses a simplified analytical structure. We have taken existing models and simplified them into a few equations that are easily understood and manipulated. The scientific basis of the greenhouse effect has been described in the preceding paper by Cline. As a result of the buildup of a number of GHGs, it is expected that significant climate changes will occur over the next century and beyond. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).","The present study has investigated strategies for coping with the likelihood of significant greenhouse warming over the coming century. It has focussed primarily upon data based on the United States and extrapolated to the rest of the world. The principal conclusions are as follows.First, an efficient strategy for coping with greenhouse warming must weigh the costs and benefits of different policies. We have surveyed the economic literature on the costs of abatement and the damages from greenhouse 
warming. Estimates of both costs and damages are highly uncertain and incomplete, and our estimates are therefore highly tentative. We investigate the impact of climate change coming from an equilibrium doubling of CO, equivalent atmospheric concentrations, which we take to be a 3 °C rise in global mean surface temperature along with the associated changes in climate. The flow of damages identified from this climate change is estimated to be about 1% of output for today's United States economy. There are clearly unmeasured and unmeasurable impacts, which might raise this impact to 1%. or at most 2% of total global output, although these higher figures are no more than an informed hunch.","The approach of economists takes a broader view. In its purest form, applied to all existing data and incorporating time discounting, this approach would conclude that climate change has little total impact on wild species. We argue that this approach misses biologically important phenomena. Here we hybridize the two approaches by applying an economists’ model to data that biologists would consider reasonable, and forego time discounting. A total of 74–91% of species that have changed have done so in accord with climate change predictions (Table 2) giving an estimate of n 0 /n ¼ 0.16 for the hybrid model. Assessment of p, the probability of correct attribution to climate, is subjective and relies on the level of confidence in inferential evidence. Such evidence comes from empirical analyses and experimental manipulations, which have documented the importance of climatic variables to the dynamics, distributions and behaviour of species3,5,8,9. From these studies, biologists infer that expected values of p are often high. We show that moderate values of p (0.35–0.70) are consistent with medium confidence in a global climate change fingerprint. The different approaches raise two distinct questions of the data and result in different levels of confidence in a climate change fingerprint. The questions are: (1) whether climate change can be shown to be an over-riding factor currently driving natural systems; and (2) whether there is sufficient evidence to implicate climate change as a common force impacting natural systems on a global scale. In an absolute sense, land-use change has probably been a stronger driver of twentieth century changes in wild plants and animals than has climate change (question 1). From a biological view, however, finding any significant climate signal amidst noisy biological data is unexpected in the absence of real climate drivers (question 2). Such small, persistent forces are inherently important in that they can alter species interactions, de-stabilize communities and drive major biome shifts.","A review of the literature reveals that the patterns that are being documented in natural systems are surprisingly simple, despite the real and potential complexity of biotic change. Change in any individual species, taxon or geographic region may have a number of possible explanations, but the overall effects of most confounding factors decline with increasing numbers of species/systems studied. Similarly, uncertainty in climate attribution for any particular study does not prevent the development of a global conclusion on the basis of a cumulative synthesis. In particular, a clear pattern emerges of temporal and spatial sign switches in biotic trends uniquely predicted as responses to climate change. With 279 species (84%) showing predicted sign switches, this diagnostic indicator increases confidence in a climate change fingerprint from either viewpoint. The published IPCC conclusion stated high confidence (P . 0.67) in a climate signal across observed biotic and abiotic changes. Analyses presented here support that conclusion. Furthermore, a driver of small magnitude but consistent impact is important in that it systematically affects century-scale biological trajectories and ultimately the persistence of species. The climate fingerprint found here implicates climate change as an important driving force on natural systems.","In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at the costs and benefits of tackling climate change",The United States is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter,The greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by human activities affect the climate,The economic costs and benefits of climate change are well known,The approach of biologists suggests that climate change is a common force impacting natural systems on a global scale,The questions are: (1) whether climate change can be shown to be an over-riding factor currently driving natural systems; and (2) whether there is sufficient evidence to implicate climate change as a common force impacting natural systems on The impacts of climate change on biotic and abiotic systems are examined in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report
The pivotal role of perceived scientific consensus in acceptance of science.,"Lewandowsky, S., Gignac, G. E., & Vaughan, S.",doi:10.1038/nclimate1720,Nature Climate Change,2012,"In light of the pervasive scientific agreement that humanity is facing a risk from climate change, and in light of indications that climate change may be outpacing projections', the public's decreasing acceptance of the science in at least some countries, and people's persistent under-estimation of the scientific consensus must give rise for concern. Public support for climate legislation has been shown to depend on people's perception of a consensus among climate scientists, with nearly 60% of the variance in policy support explained by perceived scientific consensus (through mediators involving key beliefs about AGW). However, several questions surrounding perceived consensus remain unanswered.

","First, it is unresolved how perceived consensus interacts with people's political ideology or cultural 'worldviews', which have been identified as primary obstacles to acceptance of AGW. People who endorse unregulated free markets (that is, individualistic- hierarchical libertarians"") lean towards rejection of AGW. The polarization of opinions on AGW is also reflected in a partisan split between Republicans and Democrats in the level of perceived consensus in climate science as well as other polarizing risk issues such as nuclear power. On this view, a scientific consensus is like any other fact that bears on a disputed question, and it may therefore not counteract ideological polarization. Those findings stand in contrast to a recent detailed analysis of Republicans' opinions on climate change, which revealed perceived consensus to be the strongest predictor of acceptance of climate science.
.
","Second, it is not entirely clear whether perceived scientific consensus plays a role only in politically controversial issues, such as climate science, or whether it is more generally associated with people’s acceptance of science. There are suggestions that otherwise robust aspects of decision making (for example, risk aversion) may be suspended with respect to environmental or social costs. Perceived consensus may thus play a different role in AGW than in other, non-environmental scientific issues. Finally, and most important, it is unknown whether perceived consensus contributes to acceptance of science causally, whether it is a byproduct of acceptance of science, or whether both might be caused by a third variable. Perceived consensus is known to be a  powerful causal agent in shaping and changing of attitudes, especially those relating to stereotypes and discrimination. Receiving information about the predominant attitudes among one’s peer group—viz. their views towards minority groups—tends to shift one’s attitudes in the direction of the consensus. The effect can be long-lasting and is detectable outside the context of the initial manipulation. However, there are known limits to the effectiveness of consensus in changing attitudes. In particular, a consensus-based appeal can backfire if the consensus is thought to reflect conformity with a directive from an authority rather than reflecting popular opinion. It is therefore unclear whether a declared scientific consensus might alter people’s attitudes. University scientists are among the most trusted information sources, which suggests that consensus information might facilitate public acceptance. However, scientists are also likely considered ‘authorities’ rather than ‘peers’ by the public, which might mean that consensus information can backfire when interpreted as a directive.","The studies answer the questions posed at the outset: Is perceived
scientific consensus associated with acceptance of science? Do
the processes governing acceptance of AGW differ from those
underlying other scientific issues? Does highlighting a scientific
consensus increase acceptance? What is the impact of worldview or
ideology on processing of consensus information?
The LVM in Fig. 1 answers the first two questions: Acceptance
of all scientific propositions was, in part, captured by a single
common factor, which was in turn correlated with another factor
that captured the perceived consensus among scientists themselves.
This illustrates the—hitherto imperfectly understood—association
between perceived scientific consensus and people’s attitudes.
There are two reasons to suggest that people’s knowledge and acceptance of science represents at least in part a unitary construct.
First, the pairwise correlations between consensus-belief dyads
were insufficient to capture the relationship among the manifest
variables, and two correlated factors were required to account for
people’s belief structure (viz., superior fit of Model 3 over Model 1).
Second, all propositions, ranging from AGW to medical facts with
varying strengths of association between the proposed cause and
the outcome (for example, HIV–AIDS versus obesity–ill health),
could be constrained to load equally onto their corresponding factor
without loss of fit in both studies. The general factor structure seems
quite general as it has also recently been obtained with a sample of
visitors to climate blogs24
.
","The fact that climate science is not unique is particularly notable
in light of the divisive nature of the public discussion surrounding
climate change, which at first glance suggests it might differ from
other scientific issues such as the link between lung cancer and
smoking. However, HIV-AIDS, like climate change, has its own
history of denial25,26, and the perception of a debate among scientists
about HIV is a known contributor to AIDS denial27
.
The shared importance of consensus across multiple scientific
issues is also consonant with previous findings that people’s
perceptions of risks relating to issues as diverse as nanotechnology28
and HPV vaccinations29 are often uniformly governed by their
worldviews—and people’s worldview, or personal ‘ideology’, is also
a prime candidate for a variable that can explain the remaining
true-score variance that is unaccounted for by perceived consensus.
In support, we replicated the known effect of worldview in Study 2
in the condition in which people were not given information about
the scientific consensus.","Turning to our manipulation in Study 2, highlighting the
consensus within the relevant scientific community increased
people’s acceptance of science: People were more willing to attribute
long-term climatic trends to human causes when they had been
informed of the scientific AGW consensus, and they were more
likely to accept as true the statement that human CO2 emissions
cause climate change. Notably this manipulation attenuated the
effect of free-market worldview on acceptance of AGW, because its
role—which was strongly negative in the control condition—was
eliminated on provision of the consensus information. This meshes
well with previous research which likewise found that even among
Republicans, perceived scientific consensus was by far the strongest
predictor (from among a set of 24 variables) of acceptance of climate
change13. At first glance, our results challenge the results of Kahan
and colleagues, that perceived consensus operates like any other fact
that is equally subject to dismissal as other evidence surrounding
AGW (ref. 12). However, on closer inspection, the study by Kahan
did not provide socially-normative information about a consensus
(that is, ‘97 out of 100’) but instead presented participants with an
informational vignette, attributed to a fictional expert, that either
described the risk from climate change or downplayed it. Because
this manipulation provided anecdotal rather than social-norming
information, it is not surprising that participants rated the source as
less trustworthy if the message was worldview dissonant. Normative
information, by contrast, is widely assumed to be more resilient
to ideologically-motivated dismissal30,31, a fact confirmed by the
present studies and related results13. Techniques for the delivery
of normative information to the public have been developed
in the context of AIDS-education. Delivery of peer-normative
information has been shown to reduce the incidence of high-risk
sexual behaviour32,33

Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity,"Manabe, Syukuro; Wetherald, Richard T.",doi:10.1175/1520-0469(1967)024<0241:TEOTAW>2.0.CO;2,Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences,1967,"This study is a continuation of the previous study of the thermal equilibrium of the atmosphere with a convective adjustment which was published in the JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES (Manabe and Strickler, 1964). Hereafter, we shall identify this study by M.S. In M.S. the vertical distribution of absolute humidity was given for the computation of equilibrium temperature, and its dependence upon atmospheric temperature was not taken into consideration. How- ever, the absolute humidity in the actual atmosphere strongly depends upon temperature. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of relative humidity as a function of latitude and height for summer and winter. According to this figure, the zonal mean distributions of relative humidity of two seasons closely resemble one another, whereas those of absolute humidity do not. These data suggest that, given sufficient time, the atmosphere tends to restore a certain climatological distribution of relative humidity responding to the change of temperature. If the moisture content of the atmosphere depends upon atmospheric temperature, the effective height of the source of outgoing long wave radiation also depends upon atmospheric temperature. Given a vertical distribution of relative humidity, the warmer the atmospheric temperature, the higher the effective source of outgoing radiation. Accordingly, the de- pendence of the outgoing long-wave radiation is less than that to be expected from the fourth-power law of Stefan Boltzman.","Therefore the equilibrium temperature of the atmosphere with a fixed relative humidity depends more upon the solar constant or upon absorbers such as CO2 and O3 than does that with a fixed absolute humidity, in order to satisfy the condition of radiative convective quilibrium. In this study, we will repeat the computation of radiative convective equilibrium of the atmosphere, this time for an atmo- sphere with a given distribution of relative humidity instead of that for an atmosphere with a given distri- bution of absolute humidity as was carried out in M.S.","As we stated in M.S., and in the study by Manabe and Möller (1961), the primary objective of our study of radiative convective equilibrium is the incorporation of radiative transfer into the general circulation model of the atmosphere. Adopting the scheme of the com- putation of radiative transfer which was developed in M.S., Manabe et al. (1965) successfully performed the numerical integration of the general circulation of the atmosphere involving the hydrologic cycle. In order to avoid a substantial increase in the number of degrees of freedom, the distribution of water vapor, which emerged as the result of the hydrologic cycle of the model atmosphere, was not used for the compu- tation of radiative transfer. Instead, the climatological distribution of absolute humidity was used. The next step is the numerical integration of the model with complete coupling between radiative transfer and the hydrologic cycle.","A series of radiative convective equilibrium com- putations of the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity were performed successfully.Generally speaking, the sensitivity of the surface equilibrium temperature upon the change of various factors such as solar constant, cloudiness, surface albedo, and CO₂ content are almost twice as much for the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity as for that with a given distribution of absolute humidity.","The speed of approach towards the state of equilibrium is half as much for the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity as for that with the given distribution of absolute humidity. In other words, the time required for radiation-condensation relaxation is much longer than that required for radia- tion relaxation of the mean atmospheric temperature.Doubling the existing CO₂ content of the at- mosphere has the effect of increasing the surface tem- perature by about 2.3C for the atmosphere with the realistic distribution of relative humidity and by about 1.3C for that with the realistic distribution of absolute humidity. The present model atmosphere does not have the extreme sensitivity of atmospheric temperature to the CO2 content which Möller (1963) encountered in his study when the atmosphere has a given dis- tribution of relative humidity.","A five-fold increase of stratospheric water vapor from the present value of 3X10 gm gm of air causes an increase of surface equilibrium temperature of about 2.0C, when the vertical distribution of relative humidity is fixed. Its effect on the equilibrium tem- perature of the stratosphere is larger than that of troposphere. The effects of cloudiness, surface albedo, and ozone distribution on the equilibrium temperature were also presented.",A new study of the thermal equilibrium of the atmosphere with a convective adjustment has been carried out,"The equilibrium temperature of the atmosphere with a fixed relative humidity depends more upon the solar constant or upon absorbers such as CO2 or O3 than does that with a fixed absolute humidity, in order to satisfy the condition of radiative convective quilibrium",The results of a numerical study of the cycle of the atmosphere are presented,"The influence of solar constant, cloudiness, surface albedo, and CO2 on the surface equilibrium temperature of the atmosphere has been investigated",The time required for the atmosphere to return to a state of equilibrium is much longer than the time required for the mean atmospheric temperature to return to a state of equilibrium,The influence of stratospheric water vapor on the equilibrium temperature of Earth's atmosphere has been investigated
Robust Responses of the Hydrological Cycle to Global Warming,"Held, I.M. & Soden, B.J.",doi:10.1175/jcli3990.1,Journal of Climate,2006,"There remains considerable uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the temperature response to a given increase in greenhouse gases. But there are a number of climatic responses that are tightly coupled to the temperature response. Most of these are related, directly or indirectly, to lower-tropospheric water vapor. We are confident that lower-tropospheric water vapor will increase as the climate warms. We can predict, with nearly as much confidence, that certain other changes will occur that are coupled to this increase in water vapor. In this article we describe some of these robust hydrological responses to warming.","We use the archive of coupled climate models results organized by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as our primary tool in assessing robustness. Some aspects of the hydrological responses to warming are consistent among these models and some  are not. To study the latter requires one to understand the consequences of different model formulations, often at a detailed level. When studying a consistent part of the response, in contrast, one is not concerned with the specifics of individual models, but with providing simple physical arguments that add additional support for the plausibility of the response. Some of these robust responses to warming are already well appreciated, but we gather several together here, partly for pedagogical reasons, and partly with the hope of motivating new observational studies to determine whether these responses, which the models predict are already occurring, are detectable.","As in many discussions of water vapor and global warming, our starting point is the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) expression for the saturation vapor pressure: d lnes dT L RT2 T, 1 where L is the latent heat of vaporization and R is the gas constant. At temperatures typical of the lower troposphere, 0.07 K1 ; the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% for each 1-K increase in temperature. If the equilibrium response of lowertropospheric temperatures to a doubling of CO2 is close to the canonical mean value of 3 K, this corresponds to  a 20% increase in es. Given the size of this increase, it is important to understand which aspects of the climate response are tightly coupled to the increase in es and which are not. We discuss the increase in columnintegrated water vapor, the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in horizontal sensible heat fluxes in the extratropics (in steady state), all of which are robust responses to the increase in temperature and es.","A number of important aspects of the hydrological response to warming are a direct consequence of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor. Because the increase in strength of the global hydrological cycle is constrained by the relatively small changes in radiative fluxes, it cannot keep up with the rapid increase in lower tropospheric vapor. The implication is that the exchange of mass between boundary layer and the midtroposphere must decrease, and, since much of this exchange occurs in moist convection in the Tropics, the convective mass flux must decrease. In many popular, and in some scientific, discussions of global warming, it is implicitly assumed that the atmosphere will, in some sense, become more energetic as it warms. By the fundamental measure provided by the average vertical exchange of mass between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, the atmospheric circulation must, in fact, slow down. This large-scale constraint has little direct relevance to the question of how tropical storms will be affected by global warming, since the mass exchange in these storms is a small fraction of the total tropical exchange.","In contrast, assuming that the lower-tropospheric relative humidity is unchanged and that the flow is unchanged, the poleward vapor transport and the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation (E P) increases proportionally to the lower-tropospheric vapor, and in this sense wet regions get wetter and dry regions drier. Since the changes in precipitation have considerably more structure than the changes in evaporation, this simple picture helps us understand the zonally averaged pattern of precipitation change. In the extratropics, one can alternatively think of the diffusivity for vapor and for sensible heat as being the same, with similar consequences for the change in the vapor transport. If one assumes that the statistics of the flow are also unchanged, one obtains estimates of the increase in variance of E P (the increased intensity of “droughts and floods”) that are reasonable but overestimate the response of the model variances, perhaps because of the decrease in the strength of the mass exchange.","In the Tropics, one confidently expects compensation between the increase in the equatorward latent heat transport and an increase in poleward dry static energy transport; otherwise the net transport in the Tropics would change sign. One also expects a decrease in the poleward sensible heat flux in the extratropics, as seen in many previous GCM studies. Surprisingly we see this decrease only in the equilibrium climate response as estimated with slab ocean models, and not in the transient climate change experiments. Particularly intriguing is the response in the Northern Hemisphere, where there is no reduction in the sensible heat transport despite the reduction in the zonal-mean temperature gradient at low levels associated with polar amplification of the warming. An implication of this result is that one can estimate the differential oceanic heat storage plus transport (the heat entering the ocean, with the global mean removed) directly from the Clausius–Clapeyrondominated response of the latent heat transport.",The hydrological responses to climate change are well understood,"Some of the hydrological responses to warming are already well appreciated, but we gather several together here, partly for pedagogical reasons, and partly with the hope of motivating new observational studies to determine whether these responses are already occurring","In this paper, we discuss the climate response to a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere",The effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle is discussed,"If one assumes that the lower-tropospheric relative humidity is unchanged and that the flow is unchanged, the poleward vapor transport and the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation (E P) decreases proportionally to the lower-tropospheric vapor, and in this sense wet regions get wetter and dry regions drier",The equilibrium climate response of the Tropics and the extratropics to global warming has been estimated with slab ocean models
